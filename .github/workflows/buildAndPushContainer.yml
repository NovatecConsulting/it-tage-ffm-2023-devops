# This YAML file contains a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys a Docker image to Docker Hub.
# The workflow is triggered on push events to the main branch and runs on an Ubuntu latest runner.
# It checks out the repository, sets up QEMU and Docker Buildx, logs in to Docker Hub, builds and pushes the Docker image,
# and logs out from Docker Hub.
